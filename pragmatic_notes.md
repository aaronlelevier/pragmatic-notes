# Pragmatic Programming Notes

## Ch 6. Programming by Coincidence.

- don't go on autopilot
- program deliberately
- don't program by coincidence
    - i.e. assumptions that a GUI will be present
    - that something will be in a particular state
- rely on well documented behavior
    - test behavior
- if it's assumptions for another person's API, 
document the assumptions
